# Character Animation on the ILI9486 

This repo handles the animation of 2D characters on the ILI9486. The repo uses the Arduino Mega with the ILI9486 to display a character and have that character blink, move its eyes, and move its mouth. It is very limited to the Arduino Mega's slow clock speed and minimal RAM. Othr extended hardware or a different board entirely needs to be used for expedient screen reaction.
